# Todo App with Python 2.7, Oauth2
This project was done to learn about Django's Oath2 authentication. This was done as a boilerplate application to plug in this Oath2 feature in any Django Application quickly.

Refernced tutorial: https://www.madewithtea.com/simple-todo-api-with-django-and-oauth2.html

This project is done with ```python 2```

Remember: the URL mentioned in the Tutorial(```todo_id```) is malformed or mistyped, therefore I have used another corrected one

  
For making API requets:

  - in POSTMAN, send the parameters in ```Body```,
  - Choose  ``` x-www-form-urlencoded```
